You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
  
I learned about parent and child relationship and its uses and advantages.

* What has been easy?

The way the content has been placed in the classroom is very systematic hence to learn is not a tedius task.

* What has been difficult?

Difficult to remember all the tags, need to take help from the internet.  

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
I divided the project into parts(in this case different <p> tags) and focused on each part rather than bothering about the whole problem.
